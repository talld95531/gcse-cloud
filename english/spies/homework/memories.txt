i had spent all day buiding it a gaint cube of makanix with a 
plastic plate on the time... and now it was time i took the
cube behind the building and stood on it. one of the older
kids was reading to the younger ones i could see the book
but the cube. it started to wobble. then it colapsed. i hit
my chine on the window sill and then felt a intense pain in my 
tounge. the next thing i remembre is my mum and dad driving me to the
hospital. one hosspital trip later. im eat nothing but yoghurt
and two front teath are nearly dead.

looking back on it "the cube" proboly was too filmsy to support 
my wheight ant i probly sould never of built it in the frist
place and my teath did heal in the end but the scar remained.
